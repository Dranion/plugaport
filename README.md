# plugaport
Tiny app that takes json from docs for a compatibility check. Nothing extensive.

1. Code on Google Scripts takes converts a Google Spreadsheet into a JSON file (twice!) 
2. download.php downloads the converted JSON files 
3. compat.js loads the JSON files and uses them to create a web app
